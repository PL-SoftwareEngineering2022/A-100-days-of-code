# to make our own functions:
# start out with the keyword "def" to define the function, then give the function a name.
# what differentiates a variable from a function is the parentheses.
# the colon helps to define that everything that comes after theat line and is indented is part pf the function.
def my_function():
    print("You say 'hello'")
    print("I say 'goodbye'")
