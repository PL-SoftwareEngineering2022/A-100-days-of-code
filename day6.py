# Defining Functions
        # def myfunctions():
            # Do this
            # Then do this
            # Finally do this
# to make our own functions:
# 1. start out with the keyword "def" to create or define the function, 
# 2. then give the function a name.
# what differentiates a variable from a function is the parentheses.
# the colon helps to define that everything that comes after that line and is indented is part of the function.
# 3. Calling the functions so that you can actually use them, this includes printing the name of the function and the parentheses. 
# This will let the computer know to carry out all the functions defined in the function:
        #  my_function()

def my_function():
    print("You say 'hello'")
    print("I say 'goodbye'")
# calling the function: We can define as many functions as needed and then trigger them later, which is termed as calling the function.
# this involves typing the name of the function and parentheses and any necessary inputs.
my_function()
        # You say 'hello'
        # I say 'goodbye'

# Reeborg's world:
# Draw Square

# Write a program that makes Reeborg go home.
# What you need to know
# The function move().
# Difficulty level: 1
# A robot located at (x, y) = (3, 1) carries no objects.
# Goal to achieve:
# The final position of the robot must be (x, y) = (1, 1)

# More advanced:
# You may have noticed that your solution has some repeated patterns. If you know how to define functions, define a function named jump() and use it to simplify your program.

# Indentation:
# in Python indentation can be done with either spaces or tabs
# reference: https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces
# Spaces are the preferred indentation method.
# Tabs should be used solely to remain consistent with code that is already indented with tabs.
# Python disallows mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.

# While Loops:
# while something_is_true:
    # Do something repeatedly
# while the condition is true, go into the loop and do something repeatedly until the condition becomes false.

#  for loops are great for when iterating over something 
# and to do something with each thing that you are iterating over.
#  for loops' we are setting ahead of time how many times something is going to run,
#  and it going to stop once it reaches the end of the list of items or the upper bound of the range set.
fruits = ["Apple", "pear", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# or:
for n in range(1,6):
    print(n)
#  while loops are best for when you don't care what number in a sequence you are in; 
#  which item you are iterating through in a list and you simply want to carry some 
#  sort of functionality many times until some sort if condition is set. 
#  While loops continue running until thos particular condition switches to false.
#  if the while loop never becomes false, then it becomes an infinite loop.
#  eg. 
#  while 5 > 3:
#     do abc
#  5 is larger than 3 so this while loop will never be false, 
# so the code will run until it crashes or it is stopped.

# Day 6 Project: Escaping the Maze
# Lost in a maze
# Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.
# Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
# What you need to know
# The functions move() and turn_left().
# Either the test front_is_clear() or wall_in_front(), right_is_clear() or wall_on_right(), and at_goal().
# How to use a while loop and if/elif/else statements.
# It might be useful to know how to use the negation of a test (not in Python).
